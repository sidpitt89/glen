Things To Do:

- Game Timer
  - Counts up or down

- Glass Walls
  - Breaking through glass wall starts the timer for a level
  - Maybe some are just there for fun

- Goals
  - Some sort of collectible or destroyable objective required
    for level completion

- Sliding Doors
  - Only open in response to something happening (e.g. a goal is collected)

- Different Regions
  - Speed boost region, OR just have the powered-up bullets propel you faster
  - Invisibility Region?
  - Healing / Damage Regions (Need a concept of health and damage first)

- Health & Damage
  - Need to turn on collision detection between player and damage sources / enemies
  - One hit kills you? Or have health bar?

- Graphics Overhaul
  - Maybe have very slight isometric look? Need some way to convey depth (i.e. what is a region vs. what is a wall)
  - Zoom capabilities
  - Use textures?
  - Implement some sort of Sprite system.
    - (Need to figure out how to render images with webgl first.)
    - (Look at old sprite thing you made)

- Level Progression
  - Add level sequencing controls to level editor? Make another tool?
- Level Picker
  - Way to choose levels from the side menu
  - Displays previous scores?

- Improve Level Editor
  - Made some progress, but this is an on-going process
  - Think of ways to speed up the process of adding new controls
